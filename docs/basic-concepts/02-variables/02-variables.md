# Variables
Declaring, initializing, and using variables are some of the most fundamental ideas in programming.

## Declaring and initializing variables
```
let abc = 10;
let xyz = false;
```
In Capri, all variables must be initialized when declared.

## Using variables
```
let a = 1;
let b = 2;
a + b // Evalues to 3
```
