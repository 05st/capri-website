# Installation
You can install Capri by either compiling it from source yourself or by downloading precompiled binaries.

## Compiling from source
1. Ensure [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) are installed. *
2. Clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/05st/capri.git`).
3. Run `stack build` in the cloned repository.
4. The resulting binary can be found under `./.stack-work/dist/<something>/build/capri-exe/`.

\** It's recommended to install Stack via [ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/).*
